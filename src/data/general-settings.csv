<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to TableMaster, your all-in-one solution for an enhanced dining experience and efficient restaurant management! This guide is designed to help both customers and administrators navigate and utilize the full potential of our platform. Whether you're here to book a table, order your favorite meal, or manage restaurant operations, TableMaster offers a seamless and intuitive interface.</p>
<p>Our platform integrates Point of Sale (POS) capabilities, menu management with AI-driven tools, booking and table organization, inventory tracking, expense management, marketing tools, and robust administrative settings. For developers and testers, please note that this is a prototype application where data is primarily managed via server-side CSV files, and certain features like password storage are implemented with placeholder security for demonstration purposes.</p>

<h2>2. Getting Started (For All Users)</h2>
<h3>2.1. Accessing the Application</h3>
<p>You can access TableMaster through your web browser. The homepage provides an overview of the restaurant, featured items, and quick actions.</p>

<h3>2.2. Account Management</h3>
<h4>Signing Up</h4>
<p>New users can create an account by clicking the ""Login / Sign Up"" button usually found in the header, then selecting ""Sign up"". You'll need to provide:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your Full Name</li>
    <li>A valid Email Address</li>
    <li>A Password (minimum 6 characters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon submission, an OTP (One-Time Password) will be sent to your registered email address for verification. Enter this OTP on the verification page to activate your account.</p>
<p><em><strong>Development Note:</strong> If SMTP email is not configured on the server, the OTP will be logged to the server console. For testing, the OTP ""123456"" can often be used. In a real application, OTPs are unique and time-sensitive.</em></p>

<h4>Logging In</h4>
<p>Existing users can log in using their registered email and password. If you attempt to complete an action that requires authentication (like placing an order or booking) while not logged in, your progress (e.g., cart items, booking details) will be temporarily saved in your browser. You'll be redirected to the login page, and upon successful login, you can seamlessly continue your action.</p>

<h4>Forgot Password</h4>
<p>If you've forgotten your password, click the ""Forgot Password?"" link on the login page. Enter your email address, and if an account exists, an OTP will be sent to help you set a new password.</p>

<p>This central hub provides access to various configuration panels:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>General Settings:</strong> Manage basic restaurant information (name, address, phone, legal numbers), global display currency (base currency for pricing is fixed, e.g., INR), media URLs (logos, QR codes, homepage section visuals), tax percentages (GST, VAT, Cess), operating hours, default auto-logout timeout, and content for footer and legal pages (Terms, Disclaimer, User Guide, FAQ).</li>
    <li><strong>Theme Management:</strong> Customize the application's visual themes. Create new themes, edit existing ones by defining HSL color values for light and dark modes across various UI elements (background, primary, accent, card, etc.). Apply a theme to update the <code>globals.css</code> file. Several presets are available to start from.</li>
    <li><strong>Currency Rates:</strong> Define exchange rates from the base currency (e.g., INR) to other supported currencies (e.g., USD, GBP). These rates are used for displaying prices in selected currencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Invoice & Receipt Settings:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure thermal printer profiles (name, connection type: Network IP/System, paper width, DPI, auto-cut, cash drawer options).</li>

<h2>7. Tips for Using TableMaster</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>All Users:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If you start an order or booking and are asked to log in, your progress is usually saved temporarily. Log in or sign up to continue.</li>
            <li>Check the ""My Orders"" page for updates on your takeaway orders.</li>
            <li>For bookings, you'll receive email confirmations if you've provided your email address and notifications are enabled.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Administrators:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly check the Admin Dashboard for an overview.</li>
            <li>Keep menu item availability (Admin -> Menu Management) up-to-date.</li>
            <li>Promptly manage new bookings and update their statuses (Admin -> Bookings Management).</li>
            <li>Monitor the Chef View or POS Kitchen View during service hours.</li>
            <li>Use the Data Management settings for backups (download CSVs) if needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Superadministrators:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully manage Roles and Permissions in Access Control settings, as this dictates what users can see and do.</li>
            <li>Ensure the <code>ENCRYPTION_KEY</code> in the server's <code>.env</code> file is extremely strong and kept secret if CSV encryption is desired.</li>
            <li>Configure SMTP settings in <code>.env</code> for email functionalities (OTP, notifications, invoices) to work.</li>
            <li>Regularly review Server Logs and Client Logs for any issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Troubleshooting & Support</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Issues:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Login/Signup Problems:</strong> Ensure correct email/password. If OTP is not received via email, check server console logs (if SMTP is not configured) or look for the developer test OTP (e.g., ""123456""). Ensure your account is active and not suspended.</li>
            <li><strong>Features Not Working:</strong> Some features might be conceptual or depend on server configurations (like email sending or specific AI model access).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Not Saving:</strong> For admin changes, ensure you click the relevant ""Save"" button (e.g., ""Save All to CSV"", ""Save General Settings""). Changes are often local to your session until explicitly saved to the server.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Check the FAQ:</strong> The <a href=""/faq"">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page might have answers to your query.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Support:</strong>
        <ul>

  {""q"":""I forgot my password. What should I do?"",""a"":""On the login page, click the 'Forgot Password?' link. Enter your registered email address. If an account exists for that email, an OTP will be sent to you. Use this OTP on the 'Reset Password' page to set a new password for your account.""},
  {""q"":""How can I view the restaurant's menu?"",""a"":""You can access the full menu by clicking the 'Menu' link in the header or navigating to the <code>/menu</code> page. The homepage might also feature sections like 'Explore Menu Categories' or 'Signature Dishes' that link to the menu.""},
  {""q"":""How do I book a table?"",""a"":""Navigate to the 'Book a Table' (<code>/bookings</code>) page. You'll need to fill in your contact information, the desired date and time for your booking, and the number of guests in your party. You also have the option to pre-order items from the menu (including selecting specific portions like 'Small' or 'Large', which will reflect their respective prices) and add any special requests or notes. If you're not logged in, your booking details will be saved temporarily, and you'll be prompted to log in or sign up to finalize the booking request.""},
  {""q"":""Can I order food for takeaway?"",""a"":""Yes! Go to the 'Menu' page (<code>/menu</code>). Browse the items, and if an item offers different portions (e.g., 'Half Plate', 'Full Plate', '250g'), you can select your preferred portion. The price for that specific portion will be used. Add items to your cart. When you're ready, open your cart and click 'Proceed to Checkout'. If you're not logged in, your cart will be saved, and you'll be prompted to log in or sign up to complete your takeaway order.""},
  {""q"":""How does portion selection affect the price of menu items?"",""a"":""When a menu item offers multiple portions (e.g., 'Small', 'Regular', 'Large'), each portion is defined with its own specific price in the system. When you select a particular portion while ordering (either for takeaway or pre-ordering for a booking), the price associated with that chosen portion is applied to your cart or booking. The menu and cart will display this portion-specific price.""},
  {""q"":""What are the restaurant's operating hours?"",""a"":""The restaurant's current operating hours are usually displayed on the homepage.

  {""q"":""Who can access the Admin Panel?"",""a"":""Users with 'Admin' or 'Superadmin' roles have access to the Admin Panel. The specific features and settings available within the panel depend on the user's role and the permissions assigned to that role by a Superadmin.""},
  {""q"":""What are the main responsibilities of an Administrator?"",""a"":""Administrators typically manage day-to-day restaurant operations. This includes using the Point of Sale (POS) terminal, managing menu items (including defining portions and their prices, using AI tools for content), handling table bookings, configuring restaurant tables, overseeing all customer orders, and managing basic user details for 'user' role accounts. They also have access to operational tools like inventory and expense tracking, and marketing features like discounts and offers.""},
  {""q"":""What additional privileges does a Superadministrator have?"",""a"":""Superadministrators have all the capabilities of an Administrator, plus exclusive access to the System Settings. This allows them to configure fundamental aspects of the application, such as general restaurant information, visual themes, currency rates, invoice and printer setups (invoices will reflect portion-specific pricing), email notification preferences, server rate limiting, CSV data import/export (including menu items with detailed portion pricing), encryption status, user role and permission management (Access Control), homepage layout customization, and viewing server/client application logs.""},
  {""q"":""How is application data stored in TableMaster?"",""a"":""In this prototype version of TableMaster, most application data (including menu items with their portion details and prices, orders, user accounts, all settings, etc.) is stored in CSV (Comma Separated Values) files located on the server. Superadministrators can manage this data directly via the 'Data Management' section in the Admin Settings, where they can download or upload these CSV files.""},
  {""q"":""Is my password secure in this application?"",""a"":""<strong>Important Security Note:</strong> In this prototype version of TableMaster, passwords are unfortunately stored in PLAINTEXT within a CSV file on the server. This is done purely for demonstration and testing purposes and is <em>highly insecure</em>. You should NEVER use real, sensitive, or production passwords with this application.
