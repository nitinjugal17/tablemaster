## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local instance of TableMaster up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tablemaster
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration (`.env` file)

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and configure the following variables:

- **`DATA_SOURCE`**: This is the most important setting, determining which backend to use.
  - `csv`: **(Default & Fully Implemented)** The app will use local CSV files located in `/src/data/`. This is great for getting started quickly without a database.
  - `mongodb`: **(Fully Implemented)** The app will connect to a MongoDB database.
  - `redis`: **(Conceptual)** The app is structured to support Redis, but the data actions need to be implemented. See the [Redis Setup Guide](/admin/settings/redis-guide).

- **`MONGODB_URI`** (if using `mongodb`): Your MongoDB connection string.
  - *Example: `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/`*

- **`MONGODB_DB_NAME`** (if using `mongodb`): The name of the database to use.
  - *Example: `tablemaster_db`*

- **Redis Settings** (if using `redis`):
  - `REDIS_HOST`: Hostname of your Redis server. *Default: `127.0.0.1`*
  - `REDIS_PORT`: Port of your Redis server. *Default: `6379`*
  - `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Password for your Redis server (optional).

- **`ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (Optional, for CSV mode): A strong, secret key for encrypting the CSV data files at rest. If not provided, data will be stored in plaintext.
  - *Example: `a_very_strong_32_character_secret_phrase`*
  - **Note:** Losing this key means losing access to your encrypted data.

- **Email (SMTP) Settings** (for OTP, notifications, etc.):
  - `SMTP_HOST`: e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`
  - `SMTP_PORT`: e.g., `587`
  - `SMTP_USER`: Your email username.
  - `SMTP_PASS`: Your email password or app-specific password.
  - `EMAIL_FROM`: The "From" address for outgoing emails, e.g., `"TableMaster" <no-reply@yourdomain.com>`

- **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: Your Google AI API key for using Genkit features.

### 3. Initial Setup (Critical First Steps)

#### If using CSV (`DATA_SOURCE=csv`)
The application is ready to go! On the first run, it will automatically create the necessary (and empty) `.csv` files in the `/src/data/` directory if they don't exist. The first default user is defined in `users.csv`.

#### If using MongoDB (`DATA_SOURCE=mongodb`)
When starting with an empty MongoDB database, you **must create the first superadmin user manually** to be able to log in.

1.  Connect to your MongoDB instance (e.g., using MongoDB Compass or `mongosh`).
2.  Select your database: `use your_db_name`
3.  Run the following command to insert the first user.

    > **SECURITY WARNING:** The default password system in this prototype is plaintext. For a real application, you must hash the password before inserting it.

    ```javascript
    db.getCollection("users").insertOne({
      "email": "super@example.com",
      "password": "superadminpassword", // Use a secure password
      "name": "Super Admin",
      "role": "superadmin",
      "accountStatus": "active",
      "loyaltyPoints": 0
    });
    ```
    
#### If using Redis (`DATA_SOURCE=redis`)
The Redis implementation is currently conceptual. You will need to implement the data storage logic in `src/lib/redis.ts` and the data actions in `src/app/actions/data-management-actions.ts`. For more details, visit the **Admin Panel > Settings > Redis Guide** within the application.

### 4. Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified in your environment).

## üè¢ Data Provider Architecture

TableMaster uses a flexible data provider architecture that allows you to easily switch between data backends (like CSV, MongoDB, Redis) or even add new ones (like Oracle or PostgreSQL).

- **Dispatcher (`data-management-actions.ts`):** This central file acts as a switchboard. It checks the `DATA_SOURCE` environment variable and calls the appropriate function from the relevant provider.
- **Providers:** Each data source has its own set of functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (e.g., `getUsersFromCsv`, `getUsersFromMongo`).
- **Adding a New Provider:** To add a new data source like **Oracle**, you would:
  1. Create a new file (e.g., `src/lib/oracle.ts`) to handle the database connection.
  2. In `data-management-actions.ts`, create functions like `getUsersFromOracle`.
  3. Update the main `getUsers` function in the dispatcher to call your new Oracle function when `process.env.DATA_SOURCE === 'oracle'`.

This modular approach ensures that the rest of the application remains unchanged, regardless of the data source being used.

## üöÄ Deployment & Production

For running the application in a production environment, it's highly recommended to use a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep the app alive and manage logs.

### Using PM2

1.  **Install PM2 globally:**
    ```bash
    npm install pm2 -g
    ```

2.  **Build the application for production:**
    Before running with PM2, you need to create a production build of your Next.js app.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Start the application with PM2:**
    This command starts the Next.js production server using the `npm start` script.
    ```bash
    pm2 start npm --name "tablemaster" -- start
    ```
    - `--name "tablemaster"`: Assigns a memorable name to your application process.
    - `-- start`: Tells PM2 to execute the `start` script defined in your `package.json`.

4.  **Managing the Application:**
    Here are some common PM2 commands to manage your app:
    - **List all processes:** `pm2 list`
    - **View logs:** `pm2 logs tablemaster`
    - **Restart the app:** `pm2 restart tablemaster`
    - **Stop the app:** `pm2 stop tablemaster`
    - **Delete the app from PM2's list:** `pm2 delete tablemaster`

5.  **Enable Startup Script:**
    To ensure your application restarts automatically after a server reboot, generate and run the PM2 startup script.
    ```bash
    pm2 startup
    # Follow the instructions provided by the command
    pm2 save
    ```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Guide

This section provides technical details for developers working on or extending TableMaster.

### Performance Testing & Optimization

- **Lighthouse:** Use Chrome DevTools' Lighthouse panel to audit performance, accessibility, and SEO. Aim for scores above 90 in all categories.
- **Next.js Analytics:** For production deployments on Vercel, leverage the built-in [Analytics](https://nextjs.org/analytics) to monitor Core Web Vitals and real-user performance.
- **Bundle Analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the JavaScript bundles and identify large dependencies that could be optimized or code-split.
- **Server Component Profiling:** The Next.js App Router prioritizes Server Components. Profile server-side rendering times to identify slow data-fetching operations or complex component trees.

### API Endpoints & Webhooks

The application primarily uses **Next.js Server Actions** for form submissions and data mutations, which simplifies the architecture by avoiding the need for traditional API routes for many client-server interactions. However, it does expose specific endpoints for external services and health checks.

- **Health Check:**
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/health`
  - **Description:** A simple endpoint that returns a `{ status: 'ok' }` JSON response. Used by client-side hooks to verify server connectivity.
- **Delivery Platform Webhooks:**
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/webhooks/delivery`
  - **Description:** A generic endpoint to receive real-time order notifications from third-party delivery platforms like Zomato or Swiggy.
  - **Implementation:** It currently logs the entire incoming payload and headers to the server logs for inspection. You would need to add platform-specific verification (e.g., checking HMAC signatures) and data parsing logic to create or update orders in TableMaster based on the webhook data.

### Scalability Considerations

- **Data Source:** The choice of `DATA_SOURCE` is the single most important factor for scalability.
  - **CSV:** Suitable only for single-instance, low-traffic development or very small-scale deployments. It does not support concurrent writes and will become a bottleneck quickly.
  - **MongoDB:** The recommended choice for production. It's horizontally scalable and can handle large volumes of data and concurrent users. For high performance, ensure you create indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `email` in the `users` collection, `date` in the `orders` collection).
  - **Redis:** A powerful option for high-speed scenarios. As a data source, it would excel but requires a more complex implementation to ensure data durability and structure. It's ideal for caching, session management, or as a real-time message broker between services.
- **Load Balancing:** When deploying to production with multiple server instances (e.g., using PM2 cluster mode or a cloud platform like Vercel/AWS), ensure session management is handled externally (e.g., using Redis or a database-backed session store) if you implement sticky sessions.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed, non-dynamic data. For example, general settings or menu items could be cached using Redis or Next.js's built-in `unstable_cache` function to reduce database lookups.

### Server & Client Architecture

- **Next.js App Router:** The application is built on the modern App Router, which uses Server Components by default. This reduces the amount of JavaScript shipped to the client, leading to faster initial page loads.
- **Server Components:** Pages and components in the `app` directory are Server Components unless they include the `"use client";` directive. They handle data fetching and rendering on the server.
- **Client Components:** Components requiring interactivity (e.g., using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`) must be marked with `"use client";`. These are rendered on the server for the initial HTML and then "hydrated" on the client to become interactive. Keep Client Components as small and focused as possible.
- **Server Actions:** Used for handling form submissions and mutations securely on the server without needing to create separate API routes.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  **Login:** Access the login page and use the default credentials for your chosen data source.
2.  **Admin Dashboard:** After logging in as an admin/superadmin, you will be taken to the dashboard, which provides an overview of the restaurant's status.
3.  **Configure Settings:** The most important first step is to visit **Admin Panel > Settings > General** to configure your restaurant's name, address, currency, and other core details.
4.  **Manage Data:** Use the **Admin Panel > Settings > Data Management** page to import or export data for any module via CSV. This is a powerful tool for bulk-editing or backing up your data.
5.  **Explore:** Navigate through the sidebar to explore all the features, from menu management to user roles.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How do I switch from the CSV data source to MongoDB?**  
A: 1. Set up your MongoDB database and get the connection URI. 2. Stop your TableMaster server. 3. Update the `DATA_SOURCE` variable in your `.env` file to `mongodb`. 4. Add your `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGODB_DB_NAME` to the `.env` file. 5. If it's a new database, create the first superadmin user as described in the "Initial Setup" section. 6. Restart the server. You can use the "Data Management" page to export your data from CSV and import it into your new MongoDB setup.

**Q: Is the password storage secure?**  
A: **NO.** In its current prototype state, the application uses plaintext passwords when in CSV mode for simplicity. This is **extremely insecure** and must be replaced with a proper hashing mechanism (like bcrypt or Argon2) before any real-world use. The MongoDB setup is also basic and relies on the developer to implement password hashing within the application logic for true security.

**Q: How do I add a new admin user?**  
A: As a logged-in superadmin, navigate to the "User Management" page. You can either edit an existing user's role to 'admin' or create a new user and assign them the 'admin' role. All user data is managed in the data source (either `users.csv` or the `users` collection in MongoDB).

**Q: Where are the CSV data files located?**  
A: When using the CSV data source, all data files (`.csv`, `.json`, `.txt`) are located in the `/src/data/` directory of the project.
